# TODO
# Sender Authentication
# We can also make some improvements, like
# Domain Authentication at https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth to
# improve deliverability by proving to inbox providers that you own the domain youâ€™re sending from.
#
# Send emails from own domain
# Also, instead of sending emails from accounts like &mldr@sendgrid.net,
# it would be better to have them with our domain &mldr@mydomain.com.
# In SendGrid this is called Link Branding and can be configured at:
# https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/link/create
